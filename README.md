# Moving In and Out of Time - An ADHD Experience
 
## About
<!-- Required: Include brief prose description of the project and the repository. This description should build on or contextualize the language in your Twine Object, provide concrete contextual information, or describe the possible applications of your Twine or other materials. 100 words is fine, but youâ€™re free to make this as expansive as you wish to help situate readers in your materials and how they might use them. --> 
This repository contains the source code for my Twine essay, "Moving In and Out of Time" first published in Kairos (https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/26.2/interviews/bessette/index.html). 

I wanted to recreate some of my experience of writing with ADHD using Twine's functionality of different paths and non-linear storytelling, but especially the randomizing function. I also wanted this to be a multi-sensory experience, so being able to also play with sound was important. The reader/player/user never knows, however, when there will be sound, and it doesn't always make sense which sounds are playing when. 

There is also, occasionally, an error message that appears, which I wasn't able to figure out why it was happening, but then decided, well, that's also a part of the ADHD experience! 

I do give people a few choices as to how they experience the Twine: they can go through it "linearly" or completely random. I also, for sensory reasons, do warn people that there will, somewhat randomly, be sound. I tried to find a balance between accessibility and preserving the intended experience.

## Getting Started
<!-- Give any instructions that readers may need to use your files. -->
If you download the files, you can open them in the Twine desktop app, and see the code I used for the essay. Conversely, you can visit the above site and experience the essay iself.
 
### Prerequisites
<!-- If your files require programs other than Twine, or a specific version of Twine to run, provide instructions here. -->
None
 
### Built With
<!-- If you built files with a program other than Twine, list those programs or link to downloads here. --> 
Twine

### Opening these files
<!-- Provide any necessary instructions for users to get started. You can assume that readers can download a single file and run it, but you may wish to provide guidance about how to handle certain file types or directories. -->

To open this Twine in a browser, download both the HTML and the Media file folder into a single directory. To access the code itself, open the HTML file in the Twine desktop app (https://twinery.org/).

<!-- Ex. This Twine is designed for version xyz. To edit this Twine, download version xyz from Twinery.org here: link. Download HTML and IMG files into a single directory and open in the Twine version xyz desktop program. -->

The original github repository is located at (https://github.com/Readywriting/movinginandoutoftime/tree/main). I've also made another eLit project based on the text of Moving in and Out of Time, Word Vomit, which can be experienced here: (https://readywriting.github.io/wordvomit/) and you can access the source code here: (https://github.com/Readywriting/wordvomit).

## Acknowledgments
<!-- If desired, list relevant resources you find helpful and would like to give credit to. -->
A huge thanks to [Anastasia Salter](https://github.com/AMSUCF/) who introduced me to Twine, inspired my first [critical game](https://readywriting.github.io/Adjunct-Run/), helped me find the right code to make Moving In and Out of Time work, and most recently introduced me to the resources to be able to create the Word Vomit companion piece. Literally none of this happens without them, and I am forever grateful. Also, shout-out to [The Data-Sitters Club](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/) who keep my playful and creative. 

We make fun things in an attempt to make this world better. I hope this project inspires you to do the same.
